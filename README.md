# Chef Rosetta

Deployed Application:

Chef Rosetta is an application that allows the user to search for recipes and then translate them into different languages to suit their preference.

## Description
This project was a collaboration between four bootcamp students. We were tasked with creating a unique application that would use two server-side APIs. 

We chose to use RapidAPI to fetch the APIs that we needed to complete this project. In order to search for recipes, we chose "Recipes API". "DeepL Translator" was used to translate the recipes into different languages. 

Another parameter of this project was to use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap. After looking at the different popular options, our team decided on Bulma. Bulma enabled us to create the columns and cards in the HTML. The header of the application was solely styled with the original CSS file. 

## How to Use Chef Rosetta
As you arrive on the page, you see two boxes. At first, you should type in a keyword to a recipe that you want to prepare. (Example: chicken) After you have chosen the recipe, you many then choose the language. Once you click on the language you want, you will be able to see the original recipe translated from English to your preferred language.
